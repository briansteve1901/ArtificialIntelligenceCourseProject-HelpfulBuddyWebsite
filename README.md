My friends and I created this project to fulfill Artificial Intelligence Course Project at my university. 
Helpful Buddy Website is a voice assistant website that has two features. First, the voice assistant can 
play the song that the user wants in a way that the user only needs to say the name of the song and artist 
without having to type in the song title and artist name. Second, the voice assistant can quickly tell the 
current time through users only need to ask the voice assistant about now time. The background of this project 
is research by us found that many people feel lazy to play their favorite song by typing the song name. Besides,
citizens want to know the current time in a fast way. The challenge was we didnâ€™t know what kind of problems that 
people faced in their life. We shared questionnaires with people and found the problem. Very happy that we have 
successfully created this website and scored 87 out of 100 for this project.
